# AlgEff - Algebraic Effects for F#
Algebraic effect systems provide a way to model and handle side-effects in a functional programming language. This approach has several important benefits:
* Side-effects are defined in a purely functional way
* Implementation of effects (via "handlers") is separate from the definition of the effects.
