# AlgEff - Algebraic Effects for F#
Algebraic effects provide a way to define and handle side-effects in  functional programming. This approach has several important benefits:
* Effects are defined in a purely functional way. This eliminates the danger of bugs caused by unexpected side-effects in otherwise pufunctional code.
* Implementation of effects (via "handlers") is separate from the effects' definitions. You can
